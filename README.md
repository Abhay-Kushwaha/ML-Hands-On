# 🧠 ML Features Hub - Practice Projects using Flask

Welcome to the **ML Features Hub**, a collaborative repository where we — a team of friends and developers — practice and explore **Machine Learning-based features** by building small, focused web applications. Each feature solves a specific problem and is deployed as an independent **webpage**, all neatly accessible from a **central homepage with linked cards**.

This repository is designed for **learning, experimentation, and collaboration** — with a focus on practical ML implementation using a **Flask-based backend**.

## 🚀 Features

Each folder in the repository represents a self-contained **ML-powered feature** that includes:
- 🧠 A trained machine learning model
- 🌐 A Flask app to serve predictions
- 🎨 A frontend webpage to interact with the feature
- 🧩 A card linked from the central `index.html` for navigation

### Sample Feature Ideas:
- 🌾 Crop Recommendation
- 💰 Crop Price Prediction
- 🧪 Fertilizer Recommendation
- 🦠 Disease Prediction (e.g., for crops or humans)
- 🎗️ Breast Cancer Prediction

> Each of these is a standalone module but shares the same structure and homepage for a seamless experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow / Scikit-learn / PyTorch (varies per feature)
- **Model Deployment**: Served via Flask routes
- **UI**: Linked cards for each feature from `index.html`
